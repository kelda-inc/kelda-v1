## dev

`kelda dev` creates and manages the development environment.

Specifically, it:

- Deploys the tunnels and services defined in the [workspace configuration](/kelda-v1/docs/reference/configuration#workspace-configuration).
- Syncs local changes to the services specified in the arguments.
- Displays a live status of all services and tunnels.
