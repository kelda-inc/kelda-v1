The `regcred` secret in the `kelda` namespace is automatically copied to each development namespace and added to the default Service Account.

Once you create the secret, pods booted by Kelda will be able to pull your private images.

## Creating the Secret

{{< warning heading="Every developer will have access to the registry login" >}}
We recommend using a service account instead of a user-specific Dockerhub account unless you're the only user on the cluster.
{{< /warning >}}

You can create the required secret by running the following command:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred -n kelda \
  --docker-server <REGISTRY URL> \
  --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
  --docker-password=<PASSWORD> \
  --docker-email=<EMAIL>
```

If you're using DockerHub, use `https://index.docker.io/v1/` as the `<REGISTRY URL>`. If you're using GCR, use `gcr.io`.

## Updating the Secret

If the secret already exists, you'll need to remove it before the above command will work.

```
kubectl delete secret -n kelda regcred
```
