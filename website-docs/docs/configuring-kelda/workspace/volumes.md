Because Kelda can deploy all standard Kubernetes objects, [Kubernetes Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) work out of the box.

To add a volume to your development environment, just modify the Kubernetes YAML in your [Workspace configuration](/kelda-v1/docs/reference/configuration#workspace-configuration) to reference the volume.

## Persisting State Across Pod Restarts

{{< warning heading="Persistent Volumes don't persist state across calls to `kelda delete`" >}}
The storage device associated with the PVC is released once the PVC is deleted, and Kelda deletes all objects in the namespace when `kelda delete` is called.

To persist state across pod restarts, use a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). The easiest way to create a persistent volume is with a [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#persistentvolumeclaims) (PVC).

A PVC tells Kubernetes to allocate a Persistent Volume for you. The contents of this volume will be retained even if the pod is deleted. Once a PVC is created, pods can mount it into their filesystem.

[This article](https://portworx.com/basic-guide-kubernetes-storage/) has a great explanation of how Volumes work in Kubernetes, but in most cases you can just follow one of the examples below.

{{< note heading="If PVCs aren't supported on your Kubernetes cluster..." >}}
If PVCs aren't supported on your Kubernetes cluster, you can still use Persistent Volumes. You'll just need to reference the volume directly from your pod spec.

## Example: Persisting Database State

[This example Todo application](https://github.com/kelda-inc/examples/tree/master/node-todo-with-volumes) persists the `/data/db` directory in the Mongo database across pod restarts. If you force a pod restart with `kubectl delete pod -n <namespace> <pod name>`, the database entries will still be present when Mongo boots back up.

All the YAML required to setup the volume is in the [Workspace configuration](https://github.com/kelda-inc/examples/tree/master/node-todo-with-volumes/kelda-workspace/mongodb).

The [mongodb-pvc.yaml](https://github.com/kelda-inc/examples/blob/master/node-todo-with-volumes/kelda-workspace/mongodb/mongodb-pvc.yaml) file defines the PVC. This creates a Volume that can be referenced in our Pod.

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mongo-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
  requests:
    storage: 1Gi
```

The Pod [references the volume](https://github.com/kelda-inc/examples/blob/master/node-todo-with-volumes/kelda-workspace/mongodb/mongodb-statefulset.yaml#L31):

```
volumes:
- name: data-volume
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: mongo-pvc
```

And [mounts it](https://github.com/kelda-inc/examples/blob/master/node-todo-with-volumes/kelda-workspace/mongodb/mongodb-statefulset.yaml#L25) into the container:

```
volumeMounts:
- name: data-volume
  mountPath: /data/db
```

## Resetting Your Volume

If you need to remove the files in your volume, delete and recreate it by running `kelda delete` followed by `kelda dev`.

You can also manually delete files by getting a shell in the container with `kelda ssh`, and directly `rm`ing files in the volume.
